          <h3>L-Type Blades</h3>
          <p>Crafted from high-quality 30MnCrB5 material, L-Type blades are engineered for precision and durability. Designed for deep cuts, these blades ensure only the cutting edge interacts with the soil, minimizing ground compaction while maintaining a self-sharpening profile. Ideal for shallow cultivations of 2 inches or less, they are also perfect for leveling the tillage zone, delivering exceptional performance across various soil conditions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="product">
          <h3>Super Series Blades</h3>
          <p>Engineered for toughness and exceptional performance, Super Series blades are designed to penetrate hard or clay-rich soils with ease. Constructed from a specially engineered alloy, the blades feature a thermally sprayed coating applied in a molten state to achieve superior wear resistance against abrasive forces. Additionally, these blades are precision-crafted with a hydraulically induced curve, creating a hybrid profile between L-Type and C-Type designs. This unique geometry enhances soil engagement efficiency, reduces wear rates, and ensures optimal durability for demanding applications.</p>
